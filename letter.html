        <h2>Dear Payel,</h2>
        <p>
            I just wanted to say… you're truly special to me. 💕<br><br>
            Your smile lights up my entire world. Your kindness, your heart, your strength—it all inspires me. <br>
            Every moment with you is a beautiful chapter in the story of us.<br><br>
            I built this small website just for you. Because you deserve every little happiness, every big love, and everything in between. ❤️<br><br>
            Yours forever,<br>
            <b>Elias</b> 💌
